## 2. Models
## Convolutional neural networks - semantic segmentation (UNet)
- Use python (jupyter notebook recommended)
- Run segmentation_regression_multispectral.ipynb for using raw image as input (the best model)
- Run segmentation_regression_CCDC.ipynb for using CCDC as input


## Random forests
- Use R
- Run RF&ML.R (sections 1 and 2)


## 3. Research output: Fractional built-up area map for the Himalaya (India, Nepal, and Bhutan)
- GeoTiff at 30m resolution
- Years: 1990-2000
- Range from 0 to 10000, representing 0 and 100%, respectively. Scale factor: 10000
